  <h1>Data Journalism Lab</h1>
  <p> Hi I am Navaneeth, PhD research fellow at <a href = "https://journalism.uoc.ac.in/" target="_blank">Department of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, University of Calicut.
  I research how newsrooms which produce data visualization and data stories function and how the imagination and understanding of audience reflect on the decisions of the producers </p>
  <p>
    In this space, I share collaborative works with my data journalism students at the University of Calicut, as well as my own projects.
  </p>
