  <p>
    Hi I am <b></b>Navaneeth</b>, PhD research fellow at <a href = "https://journalism.uoc.ac.in/" target="_blank">
    Department of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, University of Calicut.
  I research how newsrooms which produce data visualization and data stories function and how the imagination and understanding of audience reflect on the decisions of the producers.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    In this space, I share collaborative works with my data journalism students at the University of Calicut, as well as my own projects.
